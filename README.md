### High-Level Overview

#### What kind of app is it?

-	A web-based application designed to review and curate a list of the most frequently used words based on a particular text source and ensure the quality of the produced wordlist for typing practice or foreign language learning purposes. 
-	The system will allow language experts to classify and flag words to remove inappropriate or grammatically incorrect entries from the wordlist.

#### Who is this app for?

-	Developers or language learning content creators who need to maintain a high-quality wordlist for educational or typing practice purposes.
-	Typing tutors or foreign language teachers looking to create customized typing exercises using a reliable and error-free wordlist with high educational value.

#### What needs will it satisfy?

-	The system will provide tools for different human language experts to review entries in the wordlist, flagging words that do not meet certain criteria (e.g., nonsensical words, grammatically incorrect words, typos, profanities, and so on).
-	Language experts can suggest classification or reason for removal of flagged words.
-	The system will support role separation with different user roles:
    -	*Admin*: Manages users, assigns different roles to users, and oversees the overall process.
    -	*Content Creator/Uploader*: Uploads initial raw wordlists for review.
    -	*Human Language Expert*: Reviews and curates the wordlist.
-	It will allow collaborative reviews where multiple language experts can contribute to the refinement process.
-	Once reviewed, the system will generate a clean wordlist suitable for use in typing practice applications (such as the OverType application: https://overtype.lagogal.com/en/home ) and/or foreign language learning scenarios.
